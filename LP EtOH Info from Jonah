Hey Phoenix! 

I have some bolded answers to your questions below, but am happy to chat more about this in detail if you would like.

Approximately how much liquid is in each tray?
-	This varies depending on which extraction method the plates were used for, which specific plate of the method it is, and how many samples were extracted in that run (3-24). An average Wash 5 plate from a full run of MET-00097 will have 5 mL of liquid per well (24x5 = 120 mL). This is the most volume we would ever have in a single plate, and a better estimate of the “average” liquid would be ~16 wells, each filled with 2.5 mL of liquid (16x2.5 = 40 mL), and this is probably still on the high end. Most of the liquid that remains in these plates will be ethanol or ethanol based, some will be lysed blood or bone marrow, and some are proprietary wash reagents. 

Approximately how many trays can be placed in the waste container before it is full?
-	My estimate is that we fill these containers with ~50 plates each.

Can you please remind me of the name of the waste that generates this waste?
-	We only put waste from our KingFisher extraction runs in the loose stack containers, and the liquid component would fall under “Liquid Chemical Waste”, and the solid component under “Biohazardous Waste”. A combination of ethanol, various extraction reagents and buffers, and lysed primary samples (Blood, BM, Plasma) make up the liquid component, with the used KingFisher plates making up the solid. We do not put any other waste in these containers.
